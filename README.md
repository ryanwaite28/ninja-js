#Build A New JavaScript Library+Framework!
![](ninja-5.png)
__________________________________________

This Is A Framework That I'm Creating. It Will Combine The Power Of
BackBone's Models And Collections Architecture While Keeping Angilar's
Simplistic Data-Binding Syntax And Creative Design Features. Unlike BackBone,
Ninja Will Have No Dependencies On Any Other JS Library/Framework.

The Aim Of Ninja Is To Be A Microframework That Can Be As Minimal Or Powerful
As You Want; It Can Be Whatever You Want It To Be!
