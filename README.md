#Building A New JavaScript Library+Framework!

__________________________________________

This Is A Framework That I'm Creating. It Will Combine The Power Of
BackBone's Models And Collections Architecture, React's self-managing component based style,
While Keeping Angular's Simplistic Data-Binding Syntax And Creative Design Features. Unlike BackBone,
Ninja Will Have No Dependencies On Any Other JS Library/Framework and written to work with all browsers!

The Aim Of Ninja Is To Be A Microframework That Can Be As Minimal Or Powerful
As You Want; It Can Be Whatever You Want It To Be!
